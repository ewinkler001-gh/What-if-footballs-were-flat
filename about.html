    <h2>Author of What If Footballs Were Flat?</h2>

    <p>
        Eric R. Winkler grew up in the Midwest, where he spent his time playing sports 
        and exploring the outdoors. That early love of athletics and imagination 
        would later inspire his work as a children's book author.
    </p>

    <p>
        He earned a BSEE from Purdue University and built a career as a software engineer, 
        all while nurturing a lifelong passion for the written word. From web content 
        and poetry to short stories and love notes to his wife, writing has always been a constant.
    </p>

    <h2>From Engineer to Children's Author</h2>

    <p>
        While his professional background is rooted in technology and problem-solving, 
        Eric's creative side has always been equally important. His storytelling blends 
        humor, imagination, and energy — especially in sports-themed children's books.
    </p>

    <p>
        His debut football picture book, 
        <a href="/">What If Footballs Were Flat?</a>, 
        combines playful alliteration with fast-paced fun, 
        encouraging young readers to laugh, imagine, and enjoy the game in a whole new way.
    </p>

    <h2>Life Beyond Writing</h2>

    <p>
        Outside of writing, Eric enjoys museums, hiking, painting, woodworking, 
        and spending time with the people he cares about most. These creative and 
        hands-on pursuits continue to shape his perspective and storytelling voice.
    </p>
